      <h2>What is HAX?</h2> 
      <hr/> 
      <p><strong>A radically simple approach to <em>web authoring</em> and <em>content ownership</em>.</strong></p> 
      <p>HAX is built on the premise that any and everyone should be able to create rich, engaging content without the need for complex platforms,
         installations or vendor lock-in. The HAX block system allows for sustainable content creation that is easy to click and build for 
         novices while outputting clean, semantic HTML for experts.</p>

        There’s a reason University consistently ranks among the top one percent 
        of the world’s universities. 
        Across University campuses, our University students and University faculty and staff know the 
        real measure of success goes beyond the classroom—it’s 
        the positive impact made on communities across the world.

            pported internal to Penn State by a collaboration between several units including the College of Arts and Architecture, Eber
            ly College of Science, College of Information Sciences and Technology, and University Libraries. HAX also receives contribut
            ions from groups outside of Penn State including Buttercups LLC and community members at large. </p> </details> <details> <summary>

                  was HAX created? </summary> <div> <p> HAX is a response to a lack of products existing to meet the needs of producing 
                    accessible and engaging web content in online course environments. The university has a rich history of building a mi
                    x of custom, open source and buying repurposed commercial products with varying success. </p> <p> HAX was born out of
                       a university Request For Information (RFI) that sought to build a custom Drupal Instructional Content manage
                       ment System (iCMS). After requirements were gathered by stakeholders across the university, it was determin
                       ed that the best path forward was to build a new kind of solution as the system requirements described wer
                       e far beyond what any commercial product was offering, and no vendors responded to the Request for proposal 
                       after initial RFI process. </p> </div> </details> <details> <summary> How are decisions made? </summary> <p> D
                        ecisions about the platform are influenced by a mix of needs from students, faculty and staff either taking cou
                        rses delivered via the platform or actively building material with the platform. The direction of HAX is steered
                         by the <em>Core Product Development team</em> which meets monthly and is made up of representatives from any g
                         roup contributing development, design, or other skillsets toward the platform's development and sustainment. If 
                         you would like to join the <em>Core Product Development team</em> please co

                          with the 8-bit RPG administration design? </summary> <div> <p>Our 8-bit vibe was a design challenge pre
                            sented to four College of IST students in the Spring of 2022. They were tasked with creating
                             an over-world design that was fun, inviting, creative, and unique. The team took these requiremen
                             ts and built an experience that is playful, easy to use, and feels more like playing a video game than
